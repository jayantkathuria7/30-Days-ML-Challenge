# Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in a dataset using the Isolation Forest algorithm, a popular unsupervised learning technique for identifying rare and suspicious data points.

## üìö **Dataset Description**
The dataset used contains various features related to transactions, with anomalies indicating potential fraudulent or rare events. The features were processed before applying anomaly detection techniques.

## üîÑ **Project Workflow**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Loaded the dataset and performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Handled missing values and standardized numerical features.
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction to visualize results effectively.

### 2. **Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest**
- Used **Isolation Forest** to detect anomalies by identifying points that are easier to isolate.
- Assigned anomaly scores to each data point.
- Labeled points with high anomaly scores as fraud/anomalies.

### 3. **Visualization & Interpretation**
- Reduced the dataset to two principal components using **PCA** for visualization.
- Plotted anomalies (fraudulent points) in red and normal transactions in blue.
- Interpreted clusters and anomaly distribution in the visual representation.

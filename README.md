# üöÄ **30 Days of Machine Learning Challenge**

Welcome to my **30 Days of Machine Learning Challenge!** Over the past month, I've taken on 30 different machine learning projects, exploring a broad range of topics from basic classification to advanced deep learning and time series forecasting. This repository captures my journey, reflecting my growth as a Machine Learning enthusiast and professional.

Each project includes:
- **Jupyter Notebook** with full implementation.
- **Dataset link** for easy access.
- **Brief project overview** with insights and lessons learned.

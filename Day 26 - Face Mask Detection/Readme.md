# Face Mask Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on real-time face mask detection using deep learning and OpenCV. It classifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not, making it useful for public safety applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** Face Mask Detection Dataset (contains images of people with and without masks).
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)
- **Classes:**
  - `Mask` (Person wearing a mask)
  - `No Mask` (Person without a mask)

## ðŸ”§ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and cleaned dataset
   - Resized images to required dimensions
   - Augmented data for better model generalization

2. **Model Development**
   - Used CNN model
   - Fine-tuned layers to optimize performance

3. **Training & Evaluation**
   - Split dataset into training and validation sets
   - Achieved high accuracy on test data

4. **Real-Time Detection**
   - Integrated OpenCV for real-time face detection
   - Implemented a detection script using webcam feed
   - The model predicts mask presence in live video streams

## ðŸ“Š Results
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------|----------|------------|---------|----------|
| CNN | 95.6% | 96.1% | 95.2% | 95.6% |

# Spam Email Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Spam Email Classifier** using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails based on textual data. The classifier can be useful in filtering out unwanted emails and improving email security.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training and evaluation contains labeled email messages categorized as **Spam** or **Ham**.
- It consists of raw text data with corresponding labels.
- Preprocessing techniques like text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization were applied to prepare the data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removal of stopwords, punctuation, and special characters
   - Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization (if applied)
   - Converting text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorization
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzing word frequency distribution in spam vs. ham emails
   - Visualizing the dataset using word clouds and bar charts
3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Experimented with multiple models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
   - Chose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics
4. **Evaluation**
   - Used metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix
   
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Models:** Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest

## Results & Insights
- Achieved high accuracy in detecting spam emails.
- Observed that **Naive Bayes** performed well due to its probabilistic nature in text classification.
- TF-IDF vectorization proved effective in extracting meaningful features from text data.

## What I Learned
- Importance of **data preprocessing** in NLP tasks.
- How different **vectorization techniques** impact model performance.
- Strengths and weaknesses of **various ML models** in text classification.
- The significance of **evaluation metrics** beyond just accuracy (e.g., Precision-Recall trade-off).

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/spam-email-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd spam-email-classification
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the **Spam email classification.ipynb** file and execute the cells.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **deep learning approaches** (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) for improved classification.
- Enhance feature extraction using **word embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).
- Deploy the model as a **web app** using Flask or Streamlit for real-world usage.

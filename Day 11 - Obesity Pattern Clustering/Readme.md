# Obesity Pattern Clustering

This project focuses on clustering individuals based on lifestyle and health-related attributes to identify patterns related to obesity levels. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, the project categorizes data points into distinct groups to derive insights about obesity patterns.

## üìö **Dataset Description**

The dataset was sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition). It contains various attributes related to health, habits, and lifestyle, including:

- **Gender**: Gender of the individual  
- **Age**: Age of the individual  
- **Height**: Height in meters  
- **Weight**: Weight in kilograms  
- **family_history_with_overweight**: Family history of obesity (Yes/No)  
- **FAVC**: Frequency of consuming high-calorie foods  
- **FCVC**: Frequency of consuming vegetables  
- **NCP**: Number of main meals consumed daily  
- **CAEC**: Frequency of food consumption between meals  
- **SMOKE**: Smoking habits (Yes/No)  
- **CH2O**: Amount of water intake daily  
- **SCC**: Monitoring of daily calorie intake (Yes/No)  
- **FAF**: Frequency of physical activity  
- **TUE**: Time spent using technological devices  
- **CALC**: Frequency of alcohol consumption  
- **MTRANS**: Mode of transportation

## üîÑ **Project Workflow**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Removed missing values and ensured data consistency.
- Applied label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.
- Used standardization for feature scaling to ensure uniformity.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed data distributions through basic visualizations.
- Observed relationships between various features and obesity levels.

### 3. **Clustering Approach**
- **Algorithm Used:** Applied K-Means clustering to group the data points.
- **Choosing Number of Clusters:** Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Visualization:** Visualized clusters using a 2D plot to understand separation.

### 4. **Results & Insights**
- Identified distinct lifestyle-based clusters that highlight patterns related to obesity.
- Provided brief insights into the common characteristics within each cluster.
